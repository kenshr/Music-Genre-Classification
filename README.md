In this day and age, streaming is king when it comes to entertainment platforms. Media content consumption is at an all time high and shows no signs of stopping. Given this high demand, the entertainment landscape has become a fierce battlegrounds where companies are constantly competing for market share with new product offerings and broad content selection.

*So how do companies differentiate themselves and stand out?*

One answer is to offer exclusive content that attracts users from other platforms. However, this approach is expensive and unsustainable as a sole means of bolstering continued user engagement (i.e. companies won't always be able to win exclusive streaming rights to hot new content).

Another solution is offering users top-tier recommendations. And the value of recommender systems cannot be overstated - an article from Harvard Business Review went as far as to say that recommender systems are the "single most important algorithmic distinction between 'born digital' enterprises and legacy companies."<sup>[1](https://hbr.org/2017/08/great-digital-companies-build-great-recommendation-engines)</sup>
