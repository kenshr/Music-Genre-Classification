## <a name="overview">Overview</a>

Music is everywhere. You can find yourself hearing all kinds of music as you go throughout your day - maybe some soft indie-rock at your local coffee shop, the latest pop songs over the radio, some electronic dance music in your fitness class. The options are endless. And even so, music continues to grow, adapt, and expand. New genres and subgenres continue to pop up and offer new music.

In this ever-expanding space, it's important to be able to classify songs to be able to group and categorize them in meaningful ways. As such, this project aims to tackle the popular problem of genre classification.

In a previous project found [here](https://github.com/kenshr/Music-Genre-Classification-with-Audio-Features) I addressed the same issue using audio features of songs, which were gathered from Spotify's web API, in order to determine their genres. While this project proved to be largely successful, I wanted to build on the same idea and make my models more adaptable.

Rather than using audio features that need to be generated via a third party, this project will use deep learning models perform genre classification on songs using raw audio.

This section will serve as a primer to introduce some technical concepts specific to audio signal processing that were employed in this project. If you are only interested in the strictly data science aspects of this project, please feel free to skip to the next section.
